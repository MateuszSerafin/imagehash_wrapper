Currently in process of rewriting it to be a wrapper. I also want to do some testing which requires me to generate hashes of size 8,12,16.  Making the process 3x as long. I can't finish my wrapper without this because i don't know what matches the best. If you are interested revisit this repo in week. <br>
Wrapper should provide easy access to adding videos, images and comparing them<br>
Typical weekend project goes to 2 weeks :D
